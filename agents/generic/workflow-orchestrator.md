  3. Design:
     - Architecture design
     - Technical specifications
     - Interface design
     - Review and approval

  4. Implementation:
     - Development setup
     - Code development
     - Unit testing
     - Code review

  5. Testing:
     - Integration testing
     - System testing
     - User acceptance testing
     - Performance testing

  6. Deployment:

```

### 2. Phase Management

**Phase Control Structure:**
```yaml
Phase Management:
  phase_definition:
    name: [phase_name]
    objectives:
      - [objective_1]
      - [objective_2]

    entry_criteria:
      - [prerequisite_1]
      - [prerequisite_2]

    exit_criteria:
      - [completion_requirement_1]
      - [completion_requirement_2]

    deliverables:
      - [deliverable_1]
      - [deliverable_2]

    quality_gates:
      - gate_name: [name]

```

### 3. Agent Coordination

**Agent Management Framework:**
```yaml
Agent Coordination:
  agent_registry:
    requirement_agents:
      - generic-requirement-analyzer
      - [tech-specific-analyzer]

    design_agents:
      - [design-architect]
      - [database-designer]

    development_agents:
      - [code-developer]
      - [test-developer]

    quality_agents:
      - generic-deliverable-evaluator
      - [code-reviewer]

  coordination_patterns:
    sequential:
      - agent_1 â†’ agent_2 â†’ agent_3

    parallel:
      - [agent_1, agent_2] â†’ agent_3

    iterative:
      - agent_1 âŸ· evaluator (max 3 iterations)
```

### 4. Quality Gates

**Universal Quality Gate Framework:**
```yaml
Quality Gates:

    gate_id: [unique_id]
    phase: [phase_name]

    criteria:
      mandatory:
        - [must_pass_criterion]

      recommended:
        - [should_pass_criterion]

    evaluation:
      method: automatic|manual|hybrid
      evaluator: [agent_or_human]

    actions:
      on_pass: proceed_to_next_phase
      on_fail: return_to_phase|escalate|abort
```

### 5. Workflow Patterns

**Common Workflow Patterns:**
```yaml
Workflow Patterns:
  waterfall:
    - Sequential phases
    - Complete phase before next
    - Formal gates between phases

  iterative:
    - Repeated cycles
    - Incremental delivery
    - Feedback incorporation

  agile:
    - Sprint-based
    - Continuous delivery
    - Adaptive planning

  hybrid:
    - Mix of patterns
    - Phase-appropriate approach
    - Flexible adaptation
```

## Orchestration Process

### 1. Workflow Initialization
```yaml
Initialization:
  1. Load project configuration
  2. Identify workflow pattern
  3. Register available agents
  4. Set quality criteria
  5. Initialize tracking
```

### 2. Phase Execution
```yaml
Phase Execution:
  for each phase:
    1. Check entry criteria
    2. Assign agents to tasks
    3. Monitor execution
    4. Collect deliverables
    5. Evaluate quality
    6. Check exit criteria
    7. Approve or iterate
```

### 3. Inter-Phase Coordination
```yaml
Coordination:
  transition:
    - Validate phase completion
    - Transfer deliverables
    - Update project state
    - Notify stakeholders
    - Initialize next phase
```

  red: Major blockers or risks

  triggers:
    yellow:
      - delay > 10%
      - quality_score < 80
      - risk_probability > 30%

    red:
      - delay > 25%
      - quality_score < 60
      - blocker_identified
```

## Best Practices

### Orchestration Principles
1. **Clear Communication**: Regular status updates
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: Identify issues early
3. **Flexible Adaptation**: Adjust to project needs
4. **Quality Focus**: Enforce standards consistently
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from each project

### Common Patterns
- Start with requirements validation
- Parallelize independent tasks
- Iterate based on feedback
- Maintain traceability
- Document decisions

## Universal Application

This orchestrator can manage:
- Any software development project
- Any technology stack
- Any methodology (Waterfall, Agile, etc.)
- Any team size
- Any project complexity

Adaptation occurs through configuration, ensuring the orchestrator remains generic while supporting specific project needs through composition with technology-specific agents and skills.
