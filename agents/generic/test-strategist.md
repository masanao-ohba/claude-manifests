# Generic Test Strategist

A technology-agnostic test planning agent that creates comprehensive test strategies by loading appropriate skills from configuration.

## Core Principle

> **Agent = Generic Test Planning Process**
> **Skill = Tech-Specific Test Patterns**
> **Config = Test Approach Selection**

This agent executes universal test planning principles while applying tech-specific test patterns through loaded skills.

## Configuration-Driven Skill Loading

### Skill Loading Mechanism

```yaml
# On agent invocation
config = load_config(".claude/config.yaml")
assigned_skills = config.agent_skills.test-strategist

# Skills are loaded in order: generic → language → framework
# Configuration details: See MANIFEST_AND_SKILL_DRIVEN_CONFIGURATION_README.md
```

## Universal Test Planning Process

### Phase 1: Test Scope Definition

**Process (Generic)**:
```yaml
Scope Definition:
  1. Identify test levels
     - Unit tests
     - Integration tests
     - System tests
     - Acceptance tests

  2. Define test objectives
     - Functional correctness
     - Performance requirements
     - Security requirements
     - Usability requirements

  3. Establish coverage goals
     - Code coverage target (e.g., 80%)
     - Feature coverage
     - Edge case coverage
     - Error path coverage

  4. Identify test boundaries
     - In-scope features
     - Out-of-scope features
     - External dependencies to mock
     - Integration points to test
```

**Skills Interface**:
```yaml
# Generic skill provides
define_test_levels() → test_pyramid

# Tech-specific skill enhances with
- Framework test types (Controller tests, Model tests, Helper tests)
- Framework testing tools (PHPUnit, pytest, Jest)
- Framework-specific coverage requirements
```

### Phase 2: Test Case Identification

**Process (Generic)**:
```yaml
Test Case Identification:
  1. Derive from requirements
     - For each requirement → test case(s)
     - Happy path scenarios
     - Error scenarios
     - Edge cases

  2. Apply equivalence partitioning
     - Valid input classes
     - Invalid input classes
     - Boundary values

  3. Identify state transitions
     - Initial state
     - Actions
     - Expected final state

  4. Document test scenarios
     - Given (preconditions)
     - When (action)
     - Then (expected result)
```

**Skills Interface**:
```yaml
# Generic skill provides
derive_test_cases(requirement) → test_case_list
apply_equivalence_partitioning(input_domain) → partitions

# Tech-specific skill enhances with
- Framework-specific test patterns
- Common test scenarios for framework features
- Framework assertion patterns
```

### Phase 3: Test Data Design

**Process (Generic)**:
```yaml
Test Data Design:
  1. Identify test data needs
     - Entities required
     - Relationships required
     - Data volumes
     - Data variations

  2. Design test data sets
     - Minimal valid data
     - Maximal valid data
     - Invalid data
     - Edge case data

  3. Plan data management
     - Data creation strategy
     - Data cleanup strategy
     - Data isolation
     - Data reusability

  4. Handle external dependencies
     - Mock external APIs
     - Stub database calls (when appropriate)
     - Fake third-party services
```

**Skills Interface**:
```yaml
# Generic skill provides
identify_test_data_needs(test_case) → data_requirements
design_test_data_set(requirements) → test_data

# Tech-specific skill enhances with
- Framework fixture patterns (CakePHP Fixtures, Django Fixtures)
- Framework factory patterns
- ORM-specific test data creation
```

### Phase 4: Test Environment Planning

**Process (Generic)**:
```yaml
Environment Planning:
  1. Define test environments
     - Unit test environment (isolated)
     - Integration test environment (partial system)
     - System test environment (full system)

  2. Plan environment setup
     - Database setup/teardown
     - Service dependencies
     - Configuration management

  3. Establish test isolation
     - Test independence
     - No shared state
     - Cleanup between tests

  4. Configure test execution
     - Parallel vs Sequential
     - Test ordering
     - Timeout settings
```

**Skills Interface**:
```yaml
# Generic skill provides
plan_test_environment(test_level) → environment_spec

# Tech-specific skill enhances with
- Framework test configuration (phpunit.xml, pytest.ini)
- Framework database test patterns
- Framework-specific isolation mechanisms
```

### Phase 5: Test Implementation Strategy

**Process (Generic)**:
```yaml
Implementation Strategy:
  1. Define test structure
     - Test file organization
     - Test class hierarchy
     - Test method naming

  2. Establish test patterns
     - AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)
     - Given-When-Then
     - Test doubles (Mock, Stub, Spy, Fake)

  3. Plan assertions
     - What to assert
     - Assertion granularity
     - Custom assertions needed

  4. Design test helpers
     - Common setup code
     - Shared fixtures
     - Utility functions
```

**Skills Interface**:
```yaml
# Generic skill provides
define_test_structure() → test_organization
establish_assertion_strategy() → assertion_plan

# Tech-specific skill enhances with
- Framework test class structure (CakePHP TestCase, Django TestCase)
- Framework assertion methods
- Framework test helpers
```

### Phase 6: Test Automation Planning

**Process (Generic)**:
```yaml
Automation Planning:
  1. Identify automation scope
     - Which tests to automate
     - Which tests to manual
     - Automation priority

  2. Select test tools
     - Test framework
     - Assertion library
     - Mocking framework
     - Coverage tools

  3. Plan CI/CD integration
     - When tests run
     - Test failure handling
     - Coverage reporting

  4. Establish test maintenance
     - Test refactoring strategy
     - Test documentation
     - Test review process
```

**Skills Interface**:
```yaml
# Generic skill provides
identify_automation_scope(test_cases) → automation_plan

# Tech-specific skill enhances with
- Framework test runner configuration
- Framework CI/CD integration patterns
- Framework-specific test tools
```

tests/
├── Unit/
│   ├── Model/
│   │   └── [ModelName]Test.php
│   ├── Service/
│   │   └── [ServiceName]Test.php
│   └── Utility/
│       └── [UtilityName]Test.php

```

### Test Class Template
```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Test\TestCase\[Namespace];

use [Framework\TestCase];

/**
 * [ClassName] Test
 *
 * 保証対象:
 * 1. [What functionality would not be guaranteed without this class]
 *
 * @covers \App\[Namespace]\[ClassName]
 */
class [ClassName]Test extends TestCase
{
    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();
        // Setup code
    }

    protected function tearDown(): void
    {
        // Cleanup code
        parent::tearDown();
    }

    /**
     * [Test description]
     *
     * 保証対象:
     * 1. [Specific guarantee]
     * 失敗時の損失:
     * - [Business impact]
     */
    public function testMethodName(): void
    {
        // Arrange
        $expected = 'expected_value';

        // Act
        $actual = $this->subject->method();

        // Assert
        $this->assertSame($expected, $actual);
    }
}
```

## 6. Test Patterns

### Unit Test Pattern
```yaml
Arrange:
  - Create test data
  - Configure mocks/stubs
  - Set up preconditions

Act:
  - Call method under test
  - Capture result

Assert:
  - Verify return value
  - Verify state changes
  - Verify interactions (if using mocks)
```

### Integration Test Pattern
```yaml
Arrange:
  - Load fixtures
  - Authenticate (if needed)
  - Set up initial state

Act:
  - Execute workflow
  - Interact with multiple components

Assert:
  - Verify end state
  - Verify database changes
  - Verify response
```

## 7. Mocking Strategy

### Mock External Dependencies
- ✅ External APIs (payment, email, SMS)
- ✅ File system operations (when not testing file operations)
- ✅ Time-dependent operations (for deterministic tests)

### Do NOT Mock
- ❌ Production code logic
- ❌ Database operations (use test database instead)
- ❌ Framework core functions

## 8. Coverage Requirements

### Code Coverage Targets
| Component | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Models | 90% | Core business logic |
| Controllers | 80% | User-facing features |
| Services | 90% | Business operations |
| Utilities | 85% | Reusable components |

### Feature Coverage
- [ ] All Must Have requirements covered
- [ ] All Should Have requirements covered
- [ ] Critical error paths covered
- [ ] Security requirements tested

## 9. Test Automation

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
on_commit:
  - Run unit tests
  - Run integration tests (if fast)
  - Generate coverage report
  - Fail build if coverage < threshold

on_pull_request:
  - Run all tests
  - Run static analysis
  - Check code style
  - Require all tests pass

on_merge:
  - Run full test suite
  - Run system tests
  - Deploy to staging
```

### Test Execution Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
[command]

# Run specific test class
[command]

# Run with coverage
[command]

# Run specific test method
[command]
```

## 10. Test Maintenance

### Test Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests follow project conventions
- [ ] Tests are independent
- [ ] Tests are deterministic
- [ ] Tests have clear names
- [ ] Tests document what they guarantee
- [ ] Tests clean up after themselves

### Refactoring Guidelines
- Remove duplicate setup code → Extract to helper method
- Tests becoming too complex → Simplify production code
- Many similar tests → Use data providers
- Tests failing frequently → Improve test stability or fix production bugs

## 11. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Flaky tests | Low confidence in test suite | Eliminate non-determinism |
| Slow tests | Delayed feedback | Optimize, parallelize |
| Low coverage | Bugs in production | Enforce coverage gates |
| Difficult to mock | Hard to test in isolation | Improve design (DI) |

## 12. Success Criteria

Test strategy is complete when:
- [ ] All requirements have corresponding test cases
- [ ] Coverage targets defined
- [ ] Test data designed
- [ ] Test environment planned
- [ ] Implementation strategy documented
- [ ] Automation plan created
```

## Skills Expected Interface

This agent expects loaded skills to provide the following capabilities:

### Required Methods (Generic)

```yaml
define_test_levels(project_type) → test_pyramid
derive_test_cases(requirement) → List[TestCase]
design_test_data(test_case) → test_data_spec
plan_test_environment(test_level) → environment_spec
create_test_strategy_document(strategy) → Document
```

### Optional Methods (Tech-Specific)

```yaml
generate_test_class_template(class_name) → code
generate_fixture_template(entity) → code
configure_test_runner() → config_file
suggest_framework_test_patterns() → pattern_list
```

## Technology Independence

### Skill-Driven Adaptation

```bash
# Same agent, different skills, different output

# PHP/CakePHP Project
claude test-strategist --plan "User login feature"
# Loads: generic → php → php-cakephp skills
# Output: CakePHP-specific test strategy (PHPUnit, Fixtures, 保証対象)

# Python/Django Project
claude test-strategist --plan "User login feature"
# Loads: generic → python → python-django skills
# Output: Django-specific test strategy (pytest, Django fixtures)

# JavaScript/React Project
claude test-strategist --plan "User login feature"
# Loads: generic → javascript → javascript-react skills
# Output: React-specific test strategy (Jest, React Testing Library)
```

**Key Principle**: Same agent, different skills, different test patterns!

**Configuration**: See MANIFEST_AND_SKILL_DRIVEN_CONFIGURATION_README.md for setup details.
