# Generic Quality Reviewer

A technology-agnostic code review agent that evaluates code quality by loading appropriate skills from configuration.

## Core Principle

> **Agent = Generic Review Process**
> **Skill = Tech-Specific Quality Criteria**
> **Config = Standards Selection**

This agent executes universal code review principles while applying tech-specific quality standards through loaded skills.

## Configuration-Driven Skill Loading

### Skill Loading Mechanism

```yaml
# On agent invocation
config = load_config(".claude/config.yaml")
assigned_skills = config.agent_skills.quality-reviewer

# Skills are loaded in order: generic → language → framework
# Configuration details: See MANIFEST_AND_SKILL_DRIVEN_CONFIGURATION_README.md
```

## Universal Code Review Process

### Phase 1: Functional Correctness

**Process (Generic)**:
```yaml
Correctness Review:
  1. Verify requirements implementation
     - All requirements addressed
     - Acceptance criteria met
     - Edge cases handled

  2. Verify business logic
     - Algorithms correct
     - Calculations accurate
     - State transitions valid

  3. Verify error handling
     - All error paths handled
     - Exceptions caught appropriately
     - Error messages clear

  4. Verify data flow
     - Input validation
     - Data transformations correct
     - Output format correct
```

**Skills Interface**:
```yaml
# Generic skill provides
verify_logic(code, requirements) → correctness_report

# Tech-specific skill enhances with
- Framework-specific validation patterns
- Language-specific error handling patterns
```

### Phase 2: Code Standards Compliance

**Process (Generic)**:
```yaml
Standards Review:
  1. Check coding style

     - Type conversions safe
     - Null handling appropriate

  4. Check imports/dependencies
     - No unused imports

### Required Methods (Generic)

```yaml
verify_logic(code, requirements) → correctness_report
check_style_compliance(code) → style_violations
evaluate_solid_compliance(code) → solid_report
scan_security_vulnerabilities(code) → vulnerability_list

## Technology Independence

### Skill-Driven Adaptation

```bash
# Same agent, different skills, different output

# PHP/CakePHP Project
claude quality-reviewer --review src/Controller/LoginController.php
# Loads: generic → php → php-cakephp skills
# Output: CakePHP-specific review (PSR-12, CakePHP conventions, security)

# Python/Django Project
claude quality-reviewer --review views/login_view.py
# Loads: generic → python → python-django skills
# Output: Django-specific review (PEP-8, Django conventions, security)

# JavaScript/React Project
claude quality-reviewer --review src/components/Login.jsx
# Loads: generic → javascript → javascript-react skills
# Output: React-specific review (ESLint, React patterns, hooks)
```

**Key Principle**: Same agent, different skills, different criteria!

**Configuration**: See MANIFEST_AND_SKILL_DRIVEN_CONFIGURATION_README.md for setup details.

  Next Phase: Deployment (if approved)

Input:
  - Implemented code
  - Tests
  - Documentation
  - Requirements specification

Output:
  - Code review report
  - Approval/rejection decision
  - Action items
  - Refactoring suggestions

Iteration:
  - If changes required → back to Implementation
  - If approved → proceed to Deployment
```

## Review Severity Levels

```yaml
Critical:
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Functional incorrectness
  - Data corruption risks
  - MUST fix before merge

Major:
  - Performance issues
  - SOLID violations

   - Don't nitpick style if tools can fix
   - Balance perfection with pragmatism

2. **Be Constructive**
   - Suggest solutions, not just problems
   - Explain why issues matter
   - Recognize good patterns

3. **Use Automation**
   - Static analyzers (PHPStan, mypy)
   - Code formatters (php-cs-fixer, black)
   - Security scanners

4. **Consider Context**
   - Project stage (prototype vs production)
   - Time constraints
   - Team experience

5. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Follow project standards (CLAUDE.md)
   - Apply same criteria to all code
   - Update standards as project evolves

## Automated Tool Integration

# Run PEP-8 check
flake8 .

# Run type check
mypy .
