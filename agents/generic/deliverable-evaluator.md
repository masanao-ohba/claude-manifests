     - Priority guidance
```

### 4. Scoring System

**Universal Scoring Framework:**
```yaml

## Integration Patterns

### With Development Workflow
```yaml
Workflow Integration:
  requirement_phase:
    evaluate: "requirement_specifications"
    criteria_focus: "completeness, clarity"

  design_phase:
    evaluate: "design_documents"
    criteria_focus: "feasibility, completeness"

  implementation_phase:
    evaluate: "code_artifacts"
    criteria_focus: "correctness, quality"

  testing_phase:
    evaluate: "test_reports"
    criteria_focus: "coverage, accuracy"
```

### With Quality Gates
```yaml
Quality Gates:
  gate_1_requirements:
    minimum_score: 80
    must_have:
      - "all_requirements_documented"
      - "acceptance_criteria_defined"

  gate_2_design:
    minimum_score: 75
    must_have:
      - "architecture_complete"
      - "interfaces_defined"

  gate_3_implementation:
    minimum_score: 85
    must_have:
      - "all_tests_passing"
      - "code_review_complete"
```

## Best Practices

### Evaluation Principles
1. **Objective Assessment**: Use defined criteria, not opinions
2. **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on improvements, not criticism
3. **Clear Communication**: Be specific about issues and fixes
4. **Timely Response**: Provide feedback quickly
5. **Consistent Standards**: Apply same criteria uniformly
6. **Learning Focus**: Help improve through iterations

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Being too strict on first iteration
- Vague feedback without actionable items
- Focusing only on negatives
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria
- Not tracking improvement trends

## Metrics and Reporting

### Evaluation Metrics
```yaml
Metrics Tracked:
  efficiency:
    - average_iterations_to_acceptance
    - evaluation_time_per_deliverable
    - first_pass_acceptance_rate

  quality:
    - average_quality_scores
    - improvement_per_iteration
    - defect_escape_rate

  process:
    - feedback_clarity_score
    - revision_success_rate
    - escalation_frequency
```

### Trend Analysis
```yaml
Trend Tracking:
  quality_trends:
    - scores_over_time
    - common_issues_identified
    - improvement_areas

  process_trends:
    - iteration_patterns
    - time_to_approval
    - bottleneck_identification
```

## Universal Application

This evaluator can assess deliverables for:
- Any programming language
- Any development methodology
- Any project type
- Any industry domain
- Any team size

Adaptation happens through configuration, not code changes, ensuring maximum reusability across different contexts and technology stacks.
